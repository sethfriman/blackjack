# blackjack
The goal of this project was to find the optimal strategy for playing a hand of blackjack against a dealer. The dealer has a fixed set of rules, so using probability, a player can determine the dominant strategy for any combination of cards they have based on what the dealer is currently showing, and what could come up next. It uses a builder strategy that for each total a player has, and each card a dealer could be showing, both hits and stands a number of times and outputs the players probability of winning based on each strategy. The overall strategy is then built up so that full games can be simulated against the dealer. The strategies included are my original thought strategy based on expected values, an expert strategy found on many 'basic strategy' sites, and the builder strategy that I then created. These strategies can be compared against each other to find how each outperforms or underperforms the other.
